## Course description and aims
A cyber-physical system (CPS) is a collection of computational entities that communicate with one other and interact with the physical world via sensors and actuators. Such systems are  omnipresent today, from automobiles to smart cities.  In this course, basic concepts, theory, and issues of cyber-physical systems are examined. The course aims to ensure that students not only grasp the concepts, but also obtain basic skills to formally model and verify cyber-physical systems.

## Student learning outcomes
By the end of the course students should be able to:
1. explain the basic concepts of cyber-physical systems, reactive systems, synchronous/asynchronous computation models, dynamical systems, timed model, and hybrid systems.
2. have an understanding of safety/liveness properties of synchronous/asynchronous computation models.
3. have an understanding of the properties of dynamical systems, timed model, and hybrid systems.
