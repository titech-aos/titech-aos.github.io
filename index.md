# Advanced System Software (CSC.T431)

* Intrductor : [Prof. Takuo Watanabe (Department of Computer Science)](http://www.psg.c.titech.ac.jp/~takuo/)
* Academic Year/Quarter : 2018 / 3Q
* Days / Periods : Monday & Thursday / 1-2 (9:00-10:30)
* Room : W832

## Course description and aims
This course presents an overview of time as it relates engineering complex software systems including embedded systems. In this course, basic concepts, terminology, and issues of embedded/real-time systems are examined.

The course aims to ensure that students not only acquire the knowledge and technique required for embedded/real-time system development, but also gain skills to formally model/verify simple real-time systems.

## Student learning outcomes
By the end of the course students should be able to:
1. define what it means to be a real-time system,
2. design and develop simple embedded/real-time programs on RTOS,
3. discuss timing, scheduling and related properties, and
4. formally model and verify simple real-time systems.

## Keywords
Embedded Systems, Real-Time Systems, Real-Time Operating Systems, RTOS, Scheduling, Schedulability Analysis, Verification, Model-Checking, Timed Automata
