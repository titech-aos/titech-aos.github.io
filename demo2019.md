## Summary

### <a name="marblesorting">Marble Sorting Machine</a>

#### Team
* Ding Feng Wong
* Steven Ge

#### Project Summary
The marble sorting machine sorts marbles based on their color. The machine consists of distinct components, which need to communicate with each other in order to achieve this goal. The communication is achieved using the concepts introduced in the course.
The brain of the machine is the M5Stack development board. It uses peripherals to analyze the color of the marble and to place it at the desired location. These peripherals are three SG90 servos and an TCS34725 RGB color sensor.

### <a name="threedspacedrawing">3D space drawing</a>

#### Team: Approx! Linear System!
* Taya Yuki
* Iimuro Kazuya
* Kishinami Hidehiko

#### Project Summary
In our project, we develop new and freedom drawing system. When we draw a picture, we draw on paper with a pen(eg: pencil, ball-point pen). But, this drawing is restrained in 2D plane. We want to draw more freely. So, we develope 3D drawing system with using M5Stack. We use M5Stack as pen, and we draw in 3D space. We can draw freely as you want.

We set up web server on M5Stack and put the position data and buttons status data.
Web browser on PC accesses to the server regularly and gets these data.
Then the browser draws line based on these data, and we can see it.

We use Free-RTOS to execute following tasks.
1. Estimate M5Stack potision
  - M5Stack Gray has 9-axis IMU.
  - We can get its XYZ-acceleration from IMU.
  - We can estimate its position from its acceleration.
2. Monitor the button
  - M5Stack Gray has 3 buttons.
  - RTOS monitors if the buttons pushed or not.
  - Use one button to draw or not(on/off).
  - Use another button to change the color of pen.
  - Use the other button to reset.
3. Server task
  - Check if web server is connectable or not.
  - If web server is connectable, puts the position data and the buttons status data.
  - If web server is not connectable, sets up web server.

### <a name="m5stackway">M5Stack-Way</a>

#### Team
* Yuki Naito

#### Project Summary
M5Stack-Way is a two-wheeled robot that performs inverted pendulum control.

EV3-Way is used in the primary class of the developer department of ET Robocon.
EV3-Way is also a two-wheeled robot that performs inverted pendulum control.
This robot consists of parts sold by Afrel.
Each part is very expensive.
Therefore, a large amount of money is required when participating in the ET Robocon or when these parts are broken.
M5Stack-Way imitates EV3-Way and is assembled using inexpensive parts.

This project was started on the assumption that no color sensor was attached to M5Stack-Way.
This is because the same course as ET Robocon can't be prepared, so it is difficult to implement line trace.

In the first plan, a tail motor and an ultrasonic sensor were planned to be installed in the same way as EV3-Way.
However, both gave up mounting.
The reason for not installing the tail motor is that M5Stack doesn't have enough pins to connect the motor.
About ultrasonic sensor, this is because if the sensor is installed, the gyro sensor in the M5Stack will not operate correctly.
Therefore, M5Stack-Way is a robot with two DC motors connected.
The gyro sensor required for the inverted pendulum control uses the sensor built into the M5Stack.

M5Stack-Way performs only basic inverted pendulum control.
However, the inverted pendulum program is executed at 4ms intervals just like EV3-Way.
The PWM value, which is the rotational force of the DC motor, is calculated using the angular velocity obtained from the gyro sensor.
In order to perform inverted pendulum control, appropriate calibration is required.

### <a name="gasdetectionrobot">Gas detection robot</a>

#### Team
* LU ZHIYUAN

#### Project Summary
This project aims to make a robot that can detect natural gas and alert when abnormal.
The robot is equipped with a natural gas sensor that monitors the changes of concentration of natural gas in the air in real time. When the concentration exceeds a threshold, the robot should issues a warning. The way of warning may include sound, light, or message via the Internet.
Natural gas concentration distribution may not be uniform indoors. To be able to detect the concentration of the whole room, the robot can move autonomously to detect concentrations in different areas. The robot has two motors that enable it to move in all directions.

### <a name="fprthewifieating">FPR the Wifi eating monster</a>

#### Team: FPR
* Shinji Hoshino

#### Project Summary
A Cyber Pet (FPR) feeding simulator.

FPR is a unique pet. He lives in the cyber space and feeds off wifi hotspots.
It is your duty to find food (wifi hotspots) for it using the built-in radar.
Watch in terror as your pet grows into a huge monster!

#### How to play
1. On the default screen you can interact with FPR using the left button. (Press right button for the settings screen. More on that later.)
2. By pressing the center button you enter the wifi selection screen. Press left or right to choose a wifi. Press center to confirm. Hold the center to cancel.
3. Go walk aroud for a change.
4. Get close enough to a wifi hotspot. The screen will notify you when you are in range.
5. Hold that position for at least 5 seconds as the monster feeds off the wifi hotspot.
6. Watch in horror as FPR becomes bigger and meaner.
7. Rinse and repeat.
8. If you press the right button on the default screen, you can adjust some settings such as the volume of the beeping etc.

#### Features
a. "Cute" animations for FPR depending on its growth.
b. Computes discomfort index from temerature and humidity. FPR's growth deteroriate slower over time if it's comfortable.
c. Built in wifi hotspot radar. Beeps and blinks more rapidly as you get closer to a wifi hotspot.
d. Volume settings for the radar. (It was quite noisy with the default settings.)

#### M5Stack Features used
* WiFi scanning
* LCD
* Button
* Speaker
* Temperature and Humidity Sensors

### <a name="robotcleaner">Robot Cleaner Controller</a>

#### Team
* Tanaka Yuka

#### Project Summary
I propose a controller of the robot cleaner.
Using an ESP32 and the "Open Interface Mode" of the robot cleaner and, we can operate the robot cleaner's motion remotely.M5 stack plays the role of a remote controller. An interface of remote controller's input is three buttons and IMU sensor which M5stack has.
The system offers the real-time control of the robot cleaner. Robot cleaner moves on the trajectory or toward the direction,which user set.

### <a name="weatherhybrid">Weather Application/Thermometer/Air conditioner Hybrid</a>

#### Team
* Daniel Hu
* Valeria Jannelli
* Bernhard Glas

#### Project Summary
The project our group have been working on is a weather application/thermometer/air conditioner hybrid. The main function is that the M5stack should be connected to the internet and should download an API from a website that provides the local weather reports and from that, we should extract the necessary weather information and display it on the M5stack in a sensible way. The other function that should be on the M5stack is that it should also work like a thermometer that reads the temperature and humidity of the immediate area and display it on the M5stack with the input of a button. The temperature in the immediate area should constantly be read in the background in case the temperature and humidity suddenly rises or drops, the user should be able to know about it immediately with a click of a button. Also depending on the temperature and humidity, a “fan” for cooling and “heater” for heating should turn on.

These are the basic framework for the project, in case we have time to spare and have completed the framework above. Then there are plans to increase what out M5stack should be able to do, an example is for two M5stack to be able to send information to each other. Such as on M5stack is in another location and the “main” M5stack should be able to know the temperature in the immediate area of the other M5stacks.
